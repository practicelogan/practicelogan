The following are links to correct submissons lists for Jane Street puzzles* that my name is on and in which I utilized coding in part/full to solve.

*Jane Street's monthly puzzles are renowned for their challenging nature, pushing the limits of problem-solving and creative thinking. 
They often require advanced math and coding skills, making them a great test of technical prowess and analytical abilities.
